# Car Suggest and Price Predict Web Application
- Namaste, Everyone!
- I created this ML based car suggest and price predict application for MS ENGAGAE program 2022. The website is fully functional and useable in real life. This is easy to use. I used agile methodology for this project as mentioned as part of this program. I divided my whole task into four weeks. I started completing my tasks as sprint wise that helped in smooth learning and building the product.


## Features

- Suggest cars based on categorised specifications
- Predict negotiable price to sell or buy second hand car
- Compare engine specifications with other users
- Depict correlation statistics among car specification parameters

### Website Features Design and flow
